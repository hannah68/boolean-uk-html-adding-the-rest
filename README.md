# Adding the rest Repo

## Description 
Now that we've worked on the base layouts of these popular sites, it's time to take it a step further and start adding in the smaller details 

## Instructions 
- Recreate the Linkedin layout from the screenshot below. Also see the example to help guide you. 
- Add the components to each section of the layout Put the 3 layouts in the same repo, linking them in the main index.html 

## Tips 
- Again, work with little coloured blocks, just try to make them the right size and shape for each section of the layout 

## Challenge 
Once you're done with all 3 layouts, try turning those smaller blocks into more detailed components, with text, images, etc. Make sure they stay responsive, accommodating all the new components you add.
